# 8-Bit-Serial-Adder-Design-using-Mealy-machine
It incorporates Shift registers , counter and Adder FSM logic Unit which generates the sum output signal based upon the input carry and data from shift registers then computes the result in sum register . it was designed in Quartus Prime Lite using Verilog HDL and verified in Modedlsim. Learnt about the FSM based Design techniques in RTL design FLOW
